# Workshop Description
For AI and ML systems aimed to assist decision-making in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to perform complex reasoning under uncertainty. Moreover, in safety-critical settings, such as applications in healthcare and finance, the reasoning needs to be reliable and efficient. The emerging field of tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) is a very appealing approach in such scenarios as TPMs enable reliable (exact or coming with approximation guarantees) and efficient reasoning for a wide range of tasks, by design. The spectrum of TPMs consists of a wide variety of techniques including models with tractable likelihoods (e.g., normalizing flow and autoregressive models), tractable marginals (e.g., bounded-treewidth models and determinantal point processes), and more complex tractable reasoning tasks (e.g., probabilistic circuits) and is dynamically evolving.

This yearâ€™s workshop on Tractable Probabilistic Modeling aims to build bridges between the multitude of techniques for tractable reasoning and fields in which tractability is key (e.g., probabilistic programming, approximate Bayesian inference, causal reasoning, and complex systems).
