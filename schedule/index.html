I will start by discussing normalizing flow models, and the challenges that arise when converting these models that are typically designed for real-valued random variables to discrete random variables. Next, I will demonstrate how denoising diffusion models with discrete state spaces have a rich design space in terms of the noising process, and how this influences the performance of the learned denoising model. Finally, I will show how denoising diffusion models can be connected to autoregressive models, and introduce an autoregressive model with a random generation order. <p/> <div class=text-muted ><p><strong>Bio: </strong>Rianne is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Amsterdam, where she works on the intersection of deep learning and computational chemistry and physics for molecular simulation.

In this talk, I will describe a new unifying optimization task called constrained most probable explanation (CMPE), and show that the two aforementioned tasks, making models robust and explainable, can be reduced to CMPE. I will show that CMPE is strongly NP-hard in general on arbitrary probabilistic models, but only weakly NP-hard on probabilistic models having small k-separators (a sub-class of tractable models that admit poly-time marginal inference). The main virtue of this weakly NP-hard property is that we can leverage it to derive efficient cutset sampling and local search approximations for lower bounding the optimal value of CMPE. For upper bounding, I will present efficient approaches that combine graph-based partitioning techniques with approximations developed in the literature on knapsack problems. These upper bounding techniques are guaranteed to be better than linear programming based bounds on probabilistic models that admit tractable marginal inference and have much smaller computational complexity. I will end my talk by presenting experimental results and applications as well as avenues for future work.

Mansinghka</a></strong> (MIT, USA) <p/> <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>A great deal of enthusiasm has been focused on building increasingly large neural models. This talk will review progress along an alternate scaling route based on probabilistic programs whose source code is partly written by AI engineers and partly learned from data. This approach integrates key ideas from large-scale generative modeling and deep learning with probabilistic inference and symbolic programming. Unlike neural networks, generative probabilistic programs can report what they know, what they don’t, and why; they can be modularly designed, debugged, trained, and tested; and they can learn new symbolic code rapidly and accurately from sparse data. <br/> <br/> This talk will review probabilistic programs, written in Gen, that outperform machine learning in perceiving the 3D structure of cluttered tabletop scenes and forecasting macroeconomic time series. It will also present results from the SPPL language (based on probabilistic circuits) showing how to analyze decision tree fairness ~1000x faster than previous approaches. <br/> <br/> This talk will highlight fundamental tradeoffs between tractability and expressiveness, and discuss roles for PPL implementations of tractable probabilistic models (and of alternative notions of tractability) in scaling AI systems engineering. <p/> <div class=text-muted ><p><strong>Bio: </strong>Vikash Mansinghka is a Principal Research Scientist at MIT, where he leads the Probabilistic Computing Project.

However, training on massive data has two major limitations. First, it is contingent on exceptionally large and expensive computational resources, and incurs a substantial cost due to the significant energy consumption. Second, in many real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and fraud detection, big data contains highly imbalanced classes and noisy labels. In such cases, training on the entire data does not result in a high-quality model. In this talk, I will argue that we can address the above limitations by developing techniques that can identify and extract the most informative subsets for learning from massive datasets. Training on such subsets not only reduces the substantial costs of learning from big data, but also improves their accuracy and robustness against noisy labels. I will discuss how we can develop effective and theoretically rigorous techniques that provide strong guarantees for the learned models’ quality and robustness against noisy labels. <p/> <div class=text-muted ><p><strong>Bio: </strong>Baharan Mirzasoleiman is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at University of California Los Angeles.

In this context they are used to encode correlation structures over space and can generalise well in interpolation tasks. Despite their flexibility, off-the-shelf GPs present serious computational challenges which limit their scalability and practical usefulness in applied settings. I will present a deep generative modelling approach to tackle this challenge: for a particular spatial setting, a class of GP priors is approximated through prior sampling and subsequent training of a variational autoencoder (VAE). Given a trained VAE, the resultant decoder allows spatial inference to become incredibly efficient due to the low dimensional, independently distributed latent Gaussian space representation of the VAE. Once trained, inference using the VAE decoder replaces the GP within a Bayesian sampling framework. This approach provides tractable and easy-to-implement means of approximately encoding spatial priors and facilitates efficient statistical inference. <p/> <div class=text-muted ><p><strong>Bio: </strong>Liza is currently a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Oxford where she works on scalable methods and flexible models for spatiotemporal data.
