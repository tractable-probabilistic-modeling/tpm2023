    bio: "Emtiyaz Khan (also known as Emti) is a (tenured) team leader at the RIKEN center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) in Tokyo where he leads the Approximate Bayesian Inference Team. Previously, he was a postdoc and then a scientist at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where he also taught two large machine learning courses and received a teaching award. He finished his PhD in machine learning from University of British Columbia in 2012. The main goal of Emti’s research is to understand the principles of learning from data and use them to develop algorithms that can learn like living beings. For more than 10 years, his work has focused on developing Bayesian methods that could lead to such fundamental principles. The approximate Bayesian inference team now continues to use these principles, as well as derive new ones, to solve real-world problems."

    title: "Black Box Variational Inference with a Deterministic Objective: Faster, More Accurate, and Even More Black Box"
    abstract: "Automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) offers fast and easy-to-use posterior approximation in multiple modern probabilistic programming languages. However, its stochastic optimizer lacks clear convergence criteria and requires tuning parameters. Moreover, ADVI inherits the poor uncertainty estimates of mean-field variational Bayes (MFVB). We introduce 'deterministic ADVI' (D-ADVI) to solve these issues. In particular, we replace the intractable MFVB objective with a Monte Carlo approximation; subsequently fixing the Monte Carlo draws allows the use of off-the-shelf deterministic optimization tools. We show that D-ADVI reliably finds good solutions with default settings (unlike ADVI) and is faster and more accurate than ADVI. Moreover, unlike ADVI, D-ADVI is amenable to linear response corrections, yielding more accurate posterior covariance estimates. We demonstrate the benefits of D-ADVI on a variety of real-world problems."
